# miRNA Database and SQL Explorer
We combined curated biomedical databases such as miRBase, HMDD, PlasmiR, and more into a unified relational database. From this, we created an interactive web application that allows bioinformatics researchers to easily query across datasets and explore relationships between miRNAs, diseases, drugs, and more.
